# Release Notes - v2.0.1

## v2.0.1 - Frozen Mode Fix

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Frozen exe optimization fix** - Fixed critical issue where optimization wouldn't run in the packaged .exe
  - `sys.stderr` is `None` in PyInstaller GUI apps - all logging now uses safe wrapper
  - Thread-based optimization now works correctly in frozen mode
- **Build persistence** - IRL builds now save to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HunterSimOptimizer` for the exe (persists between runs!)
- **Battle Arena removed** - Removed the experimental battle arena visualization (was causing issues, not essential for optimization)

### 📚 Documentation
- **GitHub Issue Template** - Added build submission template for community validation data
- **Updated README** - Removed battle arena references, clarified exe behavior

## v2.0.0 - Major Release

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Revive timing bug** - Fixed critical issue where revive mechanics weren't triggered at the correct health thresholds in both Python and Rust engines
- **Boss fight edge cases** - Improved handling of multi-phase boss fights and special attacks
- **Attribute dependencies** - Fixed validation logic for talent/attribute unlock gates

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Refreshed color palette:**
  - Borge: Rich crimson theme
  - Ozzy: Vibrant emerald theme
  - Knox: Clean cobalt blue theme
- **Better progress indicators** - More granular feedback during optimization
- **Cleaner result displays** - Better formatting for large numbers and percentages

### ⚡ Performance Enhancements
- **Rust backend rebuild** - Complete rewrite of core simulation loop
  - Now sustains 100+ simulations/sec (up from ~50/sec)
  - Better memory management
  - More efficient parallel iteration with Rayon
- **Multi-threading improvements** - Optimized worker process spawning and communication
- **Reduced memory footprint** - More efficient build representation and result caching

### 🔍 Accuracy & Validation
- **Python ↔ Rust parity** - Both engines now within 0.2% of each other on average
- **WASM validation** - All hunters within ~5% of hunter-sim2.netlify.app
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Added comparison scripts for all three engines
- **Better RNG handling** - Improved consistency across simulation runs

### 📚 Documentation
- **New README** with accuracy validation section
- **Screenshots** - Auto-generated GUI and accuracy comparison images
- **Better attribution** to hunter-sim2 (community-trusted WASM site)
- **Detailed release notes** (this file!)

## Breaking Changes
None - this release is fully backward compatible with v1.x builds.

## Known Issues
- Windows Defender may flag the .exe as unknown (expected for unsigned executables)
- Very high levels (300+) may show slight variance due to floating-point precision limits
- Battle arena may stutter on low-end hardware with all 3 hunters optimizing simultaneously

## Migration Guide
If upgrading from v1.x:
1. Your IRL builds in `hunter-sim/IRL Builds/` will automatically migrate
2. No config changes needed
3. Optimization runs from v1.x are not compatible - rerun optimizations with v2.0

## What's Next?
- v2.1: Inscryption/mod support in optimizer
- v2.2: Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS)
- v3.0: Multi-run campaign mode, leaderboard integration
