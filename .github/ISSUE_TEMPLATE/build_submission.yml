        ## Thank you for contributing to formula validation! 🎉
        
        By submitting your **real in-game stats**, you help us fine-tune the simulation formulas to match the game exactly. The more data points we have, the more accurate the optimizer becomes!
        
        **Please fill out as much as you can** - even partial data is helpful!
        
        📸 **Where to find these stats**: Open your Attributes page in-game and scroll down to the stats panel at the bottom.
